# Terraform Modules Repository
Welcome to our Terraform Modules Repository, meticulously curated by Sea the Good, LLC. Our mission is to bridge the gap often found in various articles on Terraform across the internet: transitioning from basic, illustrative examples to truly production-ready code.

## Our Purpose
In the vast sea of guides and examples for deploying AWS resources, many fall short of the mark. They provide a glimpse into the potential of infrastructure as code but often leave out the robustness and completeness required for production environments. This repository aims to fill that void.

We understand that no single solution can cater to every possible need. However, we commit to ensuring that the code within this repository meets high standards of quality and reliability, making it production-grade. Our modules are designed to be directly integrated into your environment or serve as a solid foundation that you can build upon and customize for your unique requirements.

## Why Use Our Modules?
Production-Grade Quality: We strive to ensure that every module in this repository is ready for production use, emphasizing security, scalability, and maintainability.
Comprehensive: Beyond simple deployment, our modules cover considerations essential for real-world applications, aiming to provide a comprehensive solution out of the box.
Customizable: While our solutions are designed to be used as-is, we encourage adaptation and customization, making it easier for you to align with your specific operational needs.
Collaborative Improvement: This is a living repository. We welcome contributions, suggestions, and feedback to continually refine and enhance our modules.
